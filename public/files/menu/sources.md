## Sources

**Methodology and Data Sources**  
All data for this Toronto-focused project was sourced from existing open data repositories, with the aim of making these datasets more accessible and understandable to the public. The data sources used are listed below. The data was processed and analyzed using open-source GIS software and visualized through tools like React, D3.js, React Markdown, and Mapbox.

The administrative boundaries analyzed include Toronto's City Council wards, Neighborhood Improvement Areas (NIAs), and the 2021 Dissemination Areas (similar to census tracts). Where data was available across all three scales, the direct data source was used. In cases where data was not available at certain scales, particularly at the City Council ward level, a standard proportional split method was employed to aggregate data from smaller units up to the necessary scale.
